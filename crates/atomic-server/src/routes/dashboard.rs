//! Dashboard configuration endpoints.
//!
//! Currently exposes the per-DB featured-report pointer the dashboard
//! widget reads. The pointer survives report deletion: `AtomicCore`'s
//! `delete_report` clears it automatically, and `get` self-heals stale
//! values by returning `None` if the referenced report no longer exists.
//!
//! Phase 4 will surface a UI chooser on top of these two endpoints.
